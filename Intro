GENERATIVE AI 
    -- is a LLM Model built on ML using DL techniques to generate new data.(text,audio,video)

DEEP LEARNING MODELS DIVIDED INTO
    1.DISCRIMINATIVE MODEL(supervised) - learns relationship b/w Labelled data(uses conditionl Probability)
    2.GENERATIVE MODEL(unsupervised) - learns patterns in unstructured content(learns Joint Probability Distn & predicts by conditionl Probability)

Generative AI Pipeline 
  Steps to be followed
   --Data Acquisition
        -Whether Data Available(docx,pdf,xlsx,csv,txt)
        -Other Data(collecting data from DB, API, Web Scrapping)
        -No Data-->Create your Own data using LLM [if u have less data you can do data augmentation]
   --Data Preparation
   --Feature Engineering
   --Modeling
   --Evaluation
   --Deployment
   --Monitoring & Model Updating
